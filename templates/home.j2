                Katherine Martin and her family started Katieâ€™s Korner in 1983. Since the beginning, 
                our focus has been on making and marketing a high quality gourmet ice cream. Our first 
                location, located in a century old house, was the site of manufacturing and retail sales. 
                In 1987 we opened a second store in Canfield, Ohio, which later became our first franchise. 
                Unable to fulfill the requests for products, we expanded again in 1990 with the opening of 
                a retail store and manufacturing plant in Hubbard, Ohio. This facility can manufacture our 
                own specially formulated ice cream mix, as well as a variety of ice creams, sherbets, sorbets, 
                and ice cream pies.

                <p>We are not a major corporation, but a niche supplier of gourmet ice cream. We make our products 
                - not just market them. Each product is hand-crafted in our plant to assure consistent quality. Our 
                growth to date has been driven by our products, not by advertising. Currently we produce and distribute 
                over 70 flavors to our retail locations and commercial accounts. Our customers include the prestigious, 
                award winning five star resort, The Greenbrier, located in West Virginia. </p>
